| --- | --- |
| Portfolio #1 | E-commerce Product Cross - Price Elasticity |
|Language| Python|
|Libraries Used| sklearn, NLTK, Numpy, Pandas, re(Regex), matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud, statsmodels|
|Projects Count| 3|
| Author | Ileana Cabada |
| Kaggle Dataset | [Electronic_product_prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/electronic-products-prices)|


**About Portfolio** - This portfolio's main purpose is to analyze price data looking at the impact of different pricing data through time in various e-commerce platforms and measure the impression demand for brands among similar electronic products.

Hypotheses
i.e. Does product impression of company X  increase, if direct company competitor Y increases their prices on the same or similar electronic products within a certain timeframe?
Does free shipping boost impressions in electronic products? If yes, which products tend to have better results? 


**About the dataset** - 

(Explain features)

# Content 
## Part 1 .- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing ##
### 1.1.- [E-commerce Product Data Cleaning](https://github.com/ileanadatamania/MLPortfolio/blob/master/DataCleaning_Git1_1.ipynb)

 - Impressions explode, Null Values, Drop of unused Variables, Text normalization was mainly executed with Numpy, Pandas, Regex   and Matplotlib libraries

### 1.2.- [Unsupervised Text Classification with TDIF Vectorizing and Kmeans](https://github.com/ileanadatamania/MLPortfolio/blob/master/Unsupervised_Unlabelled_Product_Category_Text_Classification_TDIF_Vectorizing_Kmeans_Git1_2.ipynb)

#### **About Model Implemented**

Due that the dataset do not count with category labelling for further price analysis between similar products (**i.e. tablets, headphones**).

**Unsupervised texting clusterinng model** was implemented by using texting preprocessing techniques such as Lemmatization,Regex, Tokenization, followed by TF-IDF Vectorization and Kmeans algorithm.

Category_name and Cluster features were created from unique product names with their respective product description.  

#### Model Libraries 

- **NLTK,sklearn,RE(Regex), WordCloud, Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy**          
 
## Part 2 .- Exploratory Data Analysis ##
 
 - Quantity of unique merchants, unique products and impressions (barplot)
 - Impression Percentage Share by year and merchants (stacked barplot)
